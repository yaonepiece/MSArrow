A program help you discriminate the 4-arrow captcha better (perhaps).

# DISCLAIMER

THIS PROGRAM IS JUST A TOOL TO HELP YOU DISCRIMINATE THE ARROW PROMPT BETTER.
THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY AUTO INPUT OPTION FOR BOTTING,
AND SHOULDN'T BE USED FOR ANY CHEATING/BOTTING PURPOSE.

# Introduction

Sometimes the arrow captcha showed up when you're trying to mine a mineral can be very hard to be discriminated from the background.
Or it's just got a pretty dark color and you don't want to hurt your eyes too much.
So better with some tools! But not a cheat bot.
